            <h1>Hi, I'm <span>Hanz Po</span></h1>
            <p>
                I'm currently a Grade 11 student at Francis Libermann CHS, as a part of the STEM & Environment SHSM programs. In my free time, I enjoy coding, reading, and learning languages. 
                
                <br><br>

                Outside of class, I'm the President of the Model United Nations Club, as well as an active member of the Hacking Club, Robotics Club, and Camp Olympia team. 

                <br><br>

                Recently, I have started learning how to create web apps, and I'm looking for opportunities to build experience in software development.

                <br><br>

                Please don't hesitate to reach out!

                <p>This project was created for our school's science fair, and was selected as one of eight projects sent to continue to the Toronto Science Fair at University of Toronto Scarborough. In the project, my partner and I tested the performance of a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. We developed a graphical interface for the model, then analyzed various metrics of the model's performance in different conditions including font and color. We found that typically, fonts that more closely resembled handwriting, such as Century Gothic, had a lower chance of incorrect identification compared to fonts that looked like that of a digital alarm clock. Colour also did not play a significant role in the accuracy of the model. Additionally, the model particularly struggled with the digits 6, 8, and 9.

                <p>This was my entry into a data science competition hosted by STEM Fellowship. The objective was to investigate information regarding UNESCO's Sustainable Development Goal 7, <em>Affordable and Clean Energy</em>. I decided to see how much of an impact certain economic factors can have on whether or not a country decides to adopt clean energy. I used a Python library called Pandas and imported data from the <em>Our World in Data</em> project. Using Scikit-learn and Matplotlib, I discovered that generally speaking, countries with a higher gross domestic product and human development index were more likely to generate energy from clean sources. To complete the project, I added various maps and extra charts, using Geopandas and Draw.io. A final report was written and generated using Overleaf.

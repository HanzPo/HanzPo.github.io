            <h1>Hi, I'm <span>Hanz Po</span></h1>
            <p>
                I'm currently a Grade 12 student at Francis Libermann CHS, as a part of the STEM & Environment SHSM programs. In my free time, I enjoy coding, reading, and learning languages. 
                
                <br><br>

                Outside of class, I'm the President of the Model United Nations & Computer Science Clubs, as well as a co-lead of the Engineering Club. 

                <br><br>

                Recently, I have started learning how to create web apps, and I'm looking for opportunities to build experience in software development.

                <br><br>

                <p>At MetHacks 2023, I worked with a team of 3 to develop a full stack application intended to automate the process of writing and sending emails to companies. On the front-end, we utilized Bootstrap, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in order to quickly create a useable interface for the user. The backend was built using Python and the Flask framework, along with BeautifulSoup in order to scrape emails from the internet.

I utilized Java to read and write to a database containing recipe information, display recipes in an accessible format, filter recipes based on dietary restrictions, and calculate ingredients based on provided servings.

                <p>This project was created for our school's Science Fair, and was selected as one of eight projects sent to continue to the Toronto Science Fair at University of Toronto Scarborough. In the project, my partner and I tested the performance of a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. We developed a graphical interface for the model, then analyzed various metrics of the model's performance in different conditions including font and colour. We found that typically, fonts that more closely resembled handwriting, such as Century Gothic, had a lower chance of incorrect identification compared to fonts that looked like that of a digital alarm clock. Colour also did not play a significant role in the accuracy of the model. Additionally, the model particularly struggled with the digits 6, 8, and 9.

                <p>This was my entry into a Data Science competition hosted by STEM Fellowship. The objective was to investigate information regarding UNESCO's Sustainable Development Goal 7, <em>Affordable and Clean Energy</em>. I decided to see how much of an impact certain economic factors can have on a country's decision to adopt clean energy. I used a Python library called Pandas and imported data from the <em>Our World in Data</em> project. Using Scikit-learn and Matplotlib, I discovered that generally speaking, countries with a higher Gross Domestic Product and Human Development Index were more likely to generate energy from clean sources. To complete the project, I added various maps and extra charts, using Geopandas and Draw.io. A final report was written and generated using Overleaf.
